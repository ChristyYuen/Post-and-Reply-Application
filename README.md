# Py4Web Post and Reply Application

## Overview
This project is a web application built using [py4web](https://py4web.com/), a lightweight web framework for building Python web applications. The application allows users to create posts, reply to them, and edit their contributions in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** The application is packaged in a .zip file, and the authentication object is designed without requiring complex password criteria, streamlining the grading process.
- **Creating Posts:** Users can easily create new posts by clicking the "Add Post" button, which places the new post at the top of the feed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Posts are saved correctly, ensuring they remain visible even after reloading the page.
- **Editable Posts:** Users can edit their authored posts in place by clicking on the post itself or the dedicated edit button.
- **Reply Functionality:** 
  - Each main post has a "Reply" button that opens an empty reply form.
  - Replies are created in the position they will be displayed, right at the top of the corresponding postâ€™s replies.
  - Replies are displayed below their respective posts in reverse chronological order.
- **In-Place Editing:** Users can edit or delete their replies directly in the interface.

## Technical Details
- **Post Ordering:** Main posts are displayed in reverse chronological order, followed by their respective replies. The ordering of replies is local to each post, ensuring clarity in the discussion flow.
- **User Actions:** Users can edit or delete their replies in place, maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Lessons Learned
This project reinforced the importance of user experience design in web applications. The ability to easily create, edit, and delete posts and replies significantly enhances user interaction. I learned how to structure data in a way that respects chronological ordering while maintaining contextual relevance, which is crucial for discussions and feedback in social applications.
